# darrwin-site
This is the code repository for Jason's Darrwin site at https://darr.win/

It's an extension of my previous project, the Cloud Resume Challenge, at https://jason.darr.win/

The additions are:
1. Using a different CDN (Cloudflare this time)
2. Login page through Cloudflare Access for authentication and authorisation
3. A serverless function at the edge to append a response header
