				<h1>How I Built This</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<details>
					<summary>0. Planning<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 2 hours</p>
					<p>The outline given seem minimalistic, and there are quite a number of names I don't recognise. Who is JWT? I only recognise Virgil Van Dijk. </p>
					<p>I know the best way to proceed is take one step at a time, so as to not get overwhelmed. </p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>1. Cloudflare Account and Domain Registration<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 1 hour</p>
					<p>Took some time to think of a good domain, but with a popular name like mine, having an extra R doesn't hurt. You need the 'R's in 'great', 'adorable', 'brilliant', and the list goes on. </p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>2.1 Simple Web App<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 1 hour</p>
					<p>What is a 'simple origin web application'? It doesn't seem to have a definition online, so I can only assume I shouldn't be using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for my web app. </p>
					<p>I created a simple website on AWS before, so for this project, I will be adapting that to bring it to new heights. </p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>2.2 Proxy through Cloudflare<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 1 hour</p>
					<p>Instead of using CloudFront, proxying my traffic through Cloudflare seems like an equally good alternative. Doesn't hurt to have some flair, right? </p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>2.3 Front-end automation CI/CD<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 1 hour</p>
					<p>Given the short development timeframe given, it is critical in my opinion to set up CI/CD, to reduce manual effort, for version control, and deliver faster. There are a few options out there such as GitHub Actions, BitBucket, etc, for me, since I have used GitHub Actions before, I will stick to that like sticking to my idol - Virgil Van Dijk. </p>
					<p>Through GitHub Actions, local changes are uploaded to S3 and deployed on AWS and Cloudflare. With the time saved, I can score more goals! </p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>3.1 and 4. Cloudflare Access<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 2 hours</p>
					<p>I always wanted to integrate my site with a 3rd party identity provider like Facebook, Linkedin, Google etc but didn't have the chance (a.k.a. lazy). </p>
					<p>I settled on Linkedin, since #1 my site is created for professional reasons, and #2 the real reason is I tried following the steps for Facebook but the documentation differed from actual and I couldn't get it to work.</p>
					<p>I tested Cloudflare Access to limit to my email address, and it worked, but since I still need my site to be readable for people, I have updated it to limit by Country, as long as you can log in through a Linkedin account. </p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>3.2 In-App Authentication<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 2 hours</p>
					<p>I didn't know about JWT, and I tried researching on this topic, but couldn't make much sense of it. I also start to question the duplicated authorisation step since the next step seems to serve a similar purpose. </p>
					<p>As time is really short, I have no choice but to skip this step. </p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>5. Append New Response Header<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 2 hours</p>
					<p>With some research, I found the right Javascript that can fit the purpose. I deployed it in Cloudflare Worker, which is a service for running serverless functions at the edge. </p>
					<p>Tested it by inspecting the packets and it worked. Of cause, I'm good at headers. </p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>6. and 7. Future Pipeline<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 2 hours</p>
					<p>Adapted the code from the unanswered Cloudflare Community question but it just refused to work. The future developments can only get better then! </p>
