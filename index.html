					<h1>Introduction</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I recently came across The Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal and thought it's a pretty cool side project. To have the certifications and knowledge is admirable, but to also do the hands-on, build and debug, is respectable. </p>
					<p>To go through my own "baptism by fire", I got started and created this completely serverless site. </p>
					<p>It has a static frontend, a dynamic backend for counting the number of visitors (bottom of this page), and a DevOps pipeline to automate deployment.</p>

				<h1>How I Built This</h1>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<details>
					<summary>0. Planning<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 5 hours</p>
					<p>There is a saying in Chinese, ä¸‡äº‹å¼€å¤´éš¾, which roughly translates to everything is hard in the beginning, and it is the same for this project as well. With the minimalistic outline of the challenge, I was scratching my head on where to begin. </p>
					<p>I took some time to understand the overall architecture needed and trodded on looking for a good HTML + CSS template. </p>
				</details>

				<details>
					<summary>1. HTML and CSS Front-end<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 10 hours</p>
					<p>No beating around the bush - of cause I took a ready-made template, but while adding in the content, I figured instead of making it a duplicate of my LinkedIn page, why not outline my journey towards full-stack web development, as I develop this site? So over a couple of days in the evenings after work, I worked on getting the setup right. </p>
					<p>This involved tweaking the HTML and CSS codebase, setting up a domain and hosted zone within Route 53, and configuring S3 static site hosting.</p>
					<p>With a publicly accessible HTTP site, now it's time to make it a speedier HTTPS. </p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>2. CloudFront<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 2 hours</p>
					<p>Security is job zero, and one way to make my site more secure is by using CloudFront, which also speeds up the delivery of the site to the end-users. Two birds with one stone! </p>
					<p>The new CloudFront portal is surprisingly easy to use. I also activated AWS Certificate Manager as part of getting the TLS/SSL. </p>
					<p>As I make changes to my code, some routine tasks such as logging in, file uploading etc became more of a chore, and I realised the need for automation for the front-end through some CI/CD. </p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>3. Front-end automation CI/CD<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 5 hours</p>
					<p>With a minimal working knowledge of Git and GitHub before I started this pet project, this step could have been unimaginable. XD </p>
					<p>Through GitHub Actions, local changes are uploaded to S3, and the existing Cloudfront cache is invalidated. </p>
					<p>You may check out the GitHub Actions YAML script <a href="https://github.com/ja5on6/crc-site/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>4. Visitor counter<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 20 hours</p>
					<p>Now we come to building the backend of this site! </p>
					<p>How this setup works is through a short <a href="https://github.com/ja5on6/crc-site/blob/master/scripts/main.js" target="_blank">javascript script</a> on this page, querying the REST API endpoint on API Gateway. This triggers a Lambda function written in Python that updates and returns the visitor number from a DynamoDB table. </p>
					<p>The beauty of this is at the scale of this site, the stack is practically free! </p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>5. Back-end CI/CD with SAM<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 20 hours</p>
					<p>In step 4, while I orchestrated the back-end successfully using mainly the AWS management console, it will definitely be cooler if I can do all these automatically without logging in to the console! </p>
					<p>Never did I know it takes several software applications to be able to use SAM - namely AWS CLI, AWS SAM CLI and Docker (and Python), and it's a learning experience to pick up all of them. Thankfully with SAM, it automates the following deployment steps: build, zip code, upload to S3, create role, create/update function, create REST API, create resource, create method, update integration and create table. </p>
					<p>After some debugging, I finally managed to set up the back-end in an efficient CI/CD manner! </p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>6. Tests<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 10 hours</p>
					<p>This might be the hardest portion of the challenge, as I didn't realise testing is quite an extensive realm of its own. There are unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests/smoke tests, testing with mock AWS services using a library called moto etc. </p>
					<p>I tried Cypress as an end-to-end test, and I know there can be so much more to it. Definitely hope to get a better understanding of the testing scene in the future but for now, my tests are completed successfully. </p>
					<!--A test to review the Python code, create local repo on SAM such that when push git, the SAM application get packaged and deployed to AWS. -->
					<!-- for the python test, it is usually called an end-to-end test or smoke test, can consider cypress. Can add cypress test as a github action after deployment finishes. -->
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary>7. Reflections<span class="icon">ðŸ‘‡</span></summary>
					<p class="subDetails">~ 2 hours</p>
					<p>What a journey it is to take on this challenge, and I'm so glad I made something on my own and learnt a ton in the process!</p>
					<p>There are a few relevant traits to complete this challenge successfully, [1] to be purposeful with our learning outcomes; [2] to be good at problem-solving (to learn fast and google well!); [3] to be patient.</p>
					<p>If I were to do this again, being more informed I will certainly plan better in terms of timelines and expectations. There were times where I got rather stressed and disheartened when I thought I can finish some tasks easily and quickly when in fact there are more complexities involved. This will be applicable especially when a project involves working with teammates, and good coordination and communication are needed.</p>
					<!--To learn fast and google well. -->
					<!--Self-motivated -->
					<!-- to be good at problem solving. -->
					<!-- to be patient -->
					<!-- In this case I spend all the planning time to understand the technicals, next time, to spend more time planning the requirements and copy for the front-end -->
