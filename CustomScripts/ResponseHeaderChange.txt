/*
The following is a javascript script, deployed as a Cloudflare Worker for the site https://darr.win/
Cloudflare Worker is a service by Cloudflare to run serverless functions at the edge. 
What it does is, append a new response header with the name of “Foo” and the value of “Bar”.
After deployed and attached, one can right click within a browser to inspect updated header. You may see the attached picture "ResponseHeaderSnapshot.png".
